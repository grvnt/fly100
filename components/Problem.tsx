          Flying a paraglider is easy. Even granny can learn to soar. <br />
          <br />
          But when you find yourself standing on the ground, looking up at the
          pilots flying over your head you quickly realise becoming a competent
          XC pilot is hard. <br />
          <br />
          For accomplished XC pilots, paragliding isn&apos;t just a
          hobbyâ€”it&apos;s a lifestyle that demands dedication and daily
          practice.

          Newly licensed and low-airtime pilots often have limited experience
          flying outside of radio contact with their instructor, and without the
          support of a school, it can be daunting and difficult to find other
          pilots to fly with.
          <br />
          <br />
          Faced with this reality, pilots often struggle to progress beyond
          local flights, give up on their XC dreams and many leave paragliding
          entirely.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Without mentorship</b>, most pilots never reach their potential and
          miss out on the incredible experiences that XC paragliding has to
          offer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether you want hands on coaching or a supportive learning community,
          we have everything you need to get through the risky intermediate
          phase of your paragliding journey.
