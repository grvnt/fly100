          <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              For years, I chased numbers — longer flights, bigger XCs, podium finishes. From the outside, it looked like success. But inside, it felt hollow.
              The pressure. The comparisons. The constant measuring up.
              It dulled the magic that made me fall in love with flying.
              I&apos;d fallen into the trap of seeking validation from the outside world.
              I experienced rivalry and division within our community.
              Numbers had become the measure of our ability, enjoyment, and identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a string of accidents I was questioning why we fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming out of lockdown, at the end of 2020, I published a video on YouTube expressing this very question.
            </p>
            <p>
              But it wasn&apos;t until one chilly spring afternoon in Sweden, after two years without flying, that it hit me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soaring in light lift. No live trackers. No goals. No plans to go anywhere. No one watching.
            </p>
            <p>
              And for the first time in years, I felt it again — pure flow.
              The quiet.
              The presence.
              The pure, unfiltered joy of dancing with the sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              In that moment, I realized:
              The moments I treasured most weren&apos;t about winning or being better than anyone.
              They were about losing myself in the flight itself.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              And so, my deep internal journey began.
              I explored philosophy, psychology, and spirituality.
              I wanted to understand myself and this desire to fly more deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
              And then I discovered flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              A concept far more profound than first meets the eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around that same time, I became a father. And with that came a new responsibility — not just to come home from every flight, but to master my mind, make better decisions, and find a way to keep progressing this sport I love without sacrificing my life for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also carried the memory of my own father, who was killed in combat when I was 11. I&apos;m sure he knew what it meant to find flow in the African bush — to be fully alive in dangerous, beautiful places.
            </p>
            <p>
              That history shaped me. And it made me realize that chasing freedom doesn&apos;t mean chasing recklessness. It means cultivating presence, courage, discipline, and wisdom.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              I started applying the principles of flow, and the lessons from paragliding to the rest of my life - to work, dating, fitness and everything in between.
              I started to experience the world in a new way.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              As I grew in self-confidence and deepened my understanding of flow, I started to see deep links between paragliding and the martial arts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realised that paragliding was missing a key ingredient - the inner game: Self-Mastery through paragliding.

            <p>
              At Fly100, we see paragliding not as a sport, but as an Elemental Art.
              A sacred conversation between human, wing, and sky.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like the martial arts, such as Shaolin Kung Fu, it&apos;s a discipline for mastering ourselves through our craft.
            </p>
            <p>
              It demands presence. It reveals our fears. It tests our resilience.
              And in its purest moments, it grants us a taste of freedom few people ever experience.

          <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              Flow is our natural state when mind, body, and environment align.
              When time slows.
              When decisions become instinct.
              When you feel fully, undeniably alive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maslow called them peak experiences. The Japanese Samurai referred to the state of flow as &quot;Mu-Shin&quot; - the state of perfect harmony. 
            </p>
            <p>Mind, without mind.</p>
            <p>Mihály Csíkszentmihályi called this Flow, and discovered that this zone is the secret to happiness and what gives meaning to life.</p>
            <p>
              At Fly100, flow isn&apos;t the side effect.
              It&apos;s the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because pilots in flow don&apos;t just perform better — they become better humans.
              Calm. Clear. Grounded. Fully alive.
              And when we&apos;re better in the air, we show up better for the world below.
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium">
              That&apos;s why we fly.

          <div className="prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
            <p>
              We&apos;re not here to prove ourselves.
              We&apos;re here to lose ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              To master our minds, sharpen our awareness, and find those sacred moments where we forget the world&apos;s expectations and remember who we are.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flow Chasers pursue mastery — not validation.
              Freedom — not fear.
              Presence — not perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe you can chase distance, fly comps, and seek personal records through flow — with joy, presence, and grace.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because it&apos;s not the competition that steals the magic.
              It&apos;s the mindset we bring to it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And we believe that people in flow, no matter where they fly or what numbers they chase, make the world better.
            </p>

              And right now, the world needs more people who are fully alive.
